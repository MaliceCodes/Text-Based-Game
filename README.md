# Text-Based-Game
Just a sample text game that I had to make for my class. Not the best, but it's definitely worth the practice.

The entire point of this code was to create a game where the user has to go 
through multiple rooms to find items and escape without dying to an entity.

It's my first "Big Project" so I definitely took more time than needed to on it and may have a couple extra lines here and there,
but it'll keep practicing more and more as I continue down the line.
